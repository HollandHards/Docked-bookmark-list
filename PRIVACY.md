Privacy Policy
Effective Date: December 30, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how Vertical Bookmark Dock ("we", "us", or "our") handles your information when you use our browser extension.

1. Data Collection and Usage
We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.

Vertical Bookmark Dock is designed to operate entirely locally on your device.

Bookmarks: The extension reads your browser bookmarks solely to display them in the dock interface. This data never leaves your browser environment.

Settings: Your preferences (such as theme, position, and icon size) are stored using your browser's native storage API (chrome.storage.sync or browser.storage.sync). If you are signed in to your browser account (e.g., Google or Firefox Sync), these settings may sync across your own devices, but they are never accessible to us or any third party.

2. Third-Party Services
We do not use any third-party analytics tools (like Google Analytics) or tracking pixels. The extension does not communicate with any external servers, with one minor exception:

Favicons: To display icons for your bookmarks, the extension may fetch standard favicons from the websites you have bookmarked or use a default Google Favicon service (https://www.google.com/s2/favicons) if a local icon is not available. This is standard browser behavior for displaying bookmarks.

3. Permissions
The extension requests the minimum permissions required to function:

Bookmarks: Required to read and organize the bookmarks inside the "Vertical-bookmark-list" folder.

Storage: Required to save your customization settings (e.g., dock size, theme).

ActiveTab / Scripting: Required to allow the "Add Current Page" feature to work via the context menu.

4. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will notify users through the extension's update notes. By continuing to use the extension, you agree to the updated policy.
